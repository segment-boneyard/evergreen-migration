Command line tool for migrating from the separate `evergreen-*` packages to the new `evergreen-ui` package.

It rewrites the imports in JavaScript files to combine the all separate `evergreen-*` imports into a single `evergreen-ui` import.

_Note: only supports ES2015 `import` statements (not CommonJS `require` calls)._

yarn global add evergreen-migration
# or
npm install -g evergreen-migration
```

  --version      Prints the version.
  --help         Prints this message.
